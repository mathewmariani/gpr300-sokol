<h3>Why is my depth buffer so faint?</h3>
<p>The depth is stored in the range (0.0, 1.0) or (0.0 being closest, 1: farthest) by default. In addition, depth in perspective projection is not linear.</p>

<p>So it would make sense that the buffer is mostly white. Unless, you normalize it; which means to remap the depth buffer values between the min and max values to be between on the range (0.0, 1.0).</p>
