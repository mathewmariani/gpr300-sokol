# Intermediate Graphics Programming
<div class="highlight"></div>

<p class="lead">It is required that the prerequisite "Introduction to Modern Graphics Programming" (GPR-200) has already been completed.</p>

Students will gain a profound appreciation for the graphics pipeline by implementing 3D rendering tools, post-processing algorithms and industry-standard shaders. The animation side introduces mesh manipulation techniques, such as morphing and skeletal animation, using modern GPU-based algorithms. Linear algebra and 3D math concepts will be refreshed and/or introduced for applicable topics.

The syllabus for this course was created by Eric Winebrenner [@ewinebrenner][].
