<h3>Why is my depth buffer so faint?</h3>
<p>This is because depth in perspective projection is not linear.
By default depth buffer values are in the range (0.0, 1.0) with 0.0 being the closest and 1.0 being furthest.</p>

<p>So if you're using perspective projection it would make sense that your depth buffer is mostly white. You can map the min and max values onto the range (0.0, 1.0) is a process known as linearization.</p>
