# Intermediate Graphics Programming (GPR 300)

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  ⚠️ This adaptation and website are a work in progress.
</div>

It is required that the prerequisite "Introduction to Modern Graphics Programming" (GPR 200) has already been completed.

Students will gain a profound appreciation for the graphics pipeline by implementing 3D rendering tools, post-processing algorithms and industry-standard shaders. The animation side introduces mesh manipulation techniques, such as morphing and skeletal animation, using modern GPU-based algorithms. Linear algebra and 3D math concepts will be refreshed and/or introduced for applicable topics.

The syllabus for this course was created by Eric Winebrenner [@ewinebrenner][].

This course has been adapted to use [sokol headers][] by Andre Weissflog. The reason for this change is to give students the freedom to explore the graphics pipeline through a 3D-API wrapper for OpenGL, OpenGL ES3, WebGL2, Metal, D3D11, and WebGPU.

All demos for both assignments and worksessions can be viewed in the [showcase][].
