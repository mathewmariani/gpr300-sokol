### Clean Code Standard

This document describes the standards which all students must follow for all programming labs and assignments.

This is an example of clean code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
void print_message(const std::string& str) {
  std::printf("Hello, %s!\n", str);
}
```

That was an example of clean code.
